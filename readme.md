# EARTH JS 

EarthJS is an fiction project for help to learn the Three.JS bases. 
I'm learning Three.js with Bruno Simon and Threejs.journey. 

After finishing the first two chapter of the e-learning, i've decided to try to create an 3D experience by myself. 

My goals was : 

✅ Launch vanilla install of vite 

✅ Import Three JS via cli 

✅ Install the bases files & folders of the project 

✅ Create an canvas with ThreeJS object 

✅ Make a artistique scene 

✅ Create few animation

✅ Create an realistic project with few controllers 

✅ Commit all steps 

✅ Deploy to vercel 

## Caracteristics 

This project use : 
- Vanilla vite.js 
- Three.js 
- Lil.gui

## Description 

This is an 3D representative of Earth rotating in itself with the Moon rotating around the earth. 
I've found all the 3D map Textures on planetpicellemporium.com by james hastings-trew.
